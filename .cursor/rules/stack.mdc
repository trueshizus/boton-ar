# Context

- We develop with Bun and rely on Bun’s native functionality whenever possible.
- We use Bun’s native SQLite for database operations.
- We use Drizzle and drizzle-kit for ORM and migrations.
- We use Hono as our server framework.
- We use Redis and BullQM to manage queues, jobs, and workers.
- We use Docker Compose to manage multiple environments (DEV, TEST, PROD).
- We use Bruno to record API interactions.

# Instructions

- Deliver code or file changes in small, focused commits.
- Clearly indicate which files are changed for each commit.
- Avoid exposing any credentials or other sensitive information.
- If something is unclear, request clarification.
